AutoCrop is a macOS app that takes the pain away of manually cropping everything scanned photo inside a single scan. 

## Details 

There are a total of 5 presets (assumption: scans are on home printers with limited real estate):

* 1 photo, in either orientation
* 2 photos, both in same orientation
* 3 photos, two in same, one in the other
* 4 photos, all in the same orientation
* 5 photos, three in one orientation, two in the other
